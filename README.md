# BadAscii
The super origianl idea to make the Bad Apple clip in ascii art

to launch programm:
1) open a terminal in the repo
2) enter the lollowing command:
```
python BadApple.py 10
```
BadApple.py takes 1 (one) argument. If no argument is given, default is 1

for high resolution but high run time, use the command ```python BadApple.py 1```.
For lower resolution, and low run time, use the command```python BadApple.py 20```

this program uses the cv2 and sys libraries to read the video and read given arguments
